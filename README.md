# web-accessibility

In web accessibility, I learned about:

- **Text Contrast**: Ensuring text is readable by maintaining enough contrast between the text and background colors.
- **Alternative Text for Images**: Adding descriptive alt text for images to ensure that screen readers can convey the meaning of images to users with visual impairments.
- **Accessible Links**: Making links clear, descriptive, and easy to navigate for all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using HTML elements according to their intended purpose to provide better structure and accessibility to the content.
- **Accessible Form Fields**: Ensuring form fields are labeled correctly and can be navigated with ease, making forms more accessible for users with disabilities.
